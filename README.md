The File Handling Utility is a simple yet powerful Java Swing-based desktop application developed as part of an internship project. It provides a graphical interface to perform common file operations, helping users interact with the file system in a user-friendly way—no command-line required!

# This utility currently supports the following operations:
* Create a File – Choose a directory and create a new text file.
* Create a Folder – Select a location to create a new directory.
* Write to File – Add or overwrite content inside a text file.
* Read a File – Open and display content of a selected file using BufferedReader.
* Rename a File or Folder – Select an existing file or folder and give it a new name.
* Delete a File or Folder – Permanently remove a selected file or directory after confirmation.
* Append Text to a File – Append additional text to an existing file without erasing old content.

# Technologies Used
Java SE 8+
Java Swing – for GUI development
JFileChooser – for file/folder selection dialogs
BufferedReader / BufferedWriter – for file read/write
Object-Oriented Design – modular classes for operations

# How to Run
Clone the repository or download the .java files.
Compile the project using any Java IDE (like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans).
Run the Main.java file.
The GUI will launch allowing you to perform various file handling tasks interactively.
